- **POST** `/login`: Logs in an existing user.
  - Body: `{ "username": "string", "password": "string" }`
  
- **POST** `/transaction`: Adds a transaction for a user.
  - Body: `{ "user_id": "int", "category": "string", "amount": "decimal", "transaction_date": "YYYY-MM-DD" }`
  
- **GET** `/transactions/:userId`: Retrieves all transactions for a specific user.
  - Params: `userId` (user's unique ID)

## Component Breakdown

| Component | Purpose |
| :-------- | :------ |
| **Luxury.js** | Calculates and tracks luxury item spending. Provides totals and spending summaries. |
| **MonthlyCalculator.js** | Manages monthly expenses by category, visualizes them with graphs, and allows category editing. |
| **MortgageCalculator.js** | Computes monthly mortgage payments using standard amortization formulas. Includes an internal regression testing suite for validation. |
| **Vacation.js** | Helps plan a vacation by adding multiple expense items. Supports deleting individual expenses and recalculating totals. |
| **OnScreenCalculator.js** | Provides a simple, small calculator embedded on the UI for easy calculations during user interaction. |
| **Backend** | Handles user registration, login, and transaction management with a MySQL database using Express.js. |

---

## Testing Details

- **MortgageCalculator** includes a **custom Regression Testing** mechanism.
- Test cases validate mortgage calculations against known expected results to ensure the core calculation logic remains **accurate over time**.
- Validation messages ensure user inputs are **numerical and within reasonable ranges** for all tools.

---

## Future Improvements (Planned)

- **Authentication System** to save user data locally or on the cloud.
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Integrate charts like pie charts, bar graphs (e.g., with Chart.js or Recharts).
- **Persistent Storage**: Use LocalStorage or back-end APIs to save user entries.
- **Dark Mode** toggle and customizable themes.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** capabilities for offline use.
